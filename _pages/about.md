#### **Hello**

I am an undergraduate student currently in my sophomore year at Korea University, pursuing a degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. My primary interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its real-world applications in enhancing communication between machines and humans.

I also maintain a tech blog in both English and Korean, with posts tagged as `(ENG)` for English and `(KOR)` for Korean to separate the content.

For my full Curriculum Vitae, please refer to the [CV page](https://joohunhyun.github.io/cv/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
